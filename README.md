# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Crunching the numbers in order to perform analysis on theatre Kickstarter data for a client, Louise. 

Module 1 Practice

* Overview
  * The purpose of this analysis was to learn how to use excel based off the instructions provided. The example provided indicated a client, Loiusa, who was looking to have a fundraising goal of $12,000 for a play she wanted to produce, but she made a very educated decision to ask someone to crunch the numbers for her. 
  * Louisa also had a futuristic goal of fundraising and producing a musical in Great Britain. She estimated she would need about 4000 pounds in order to produce this piece. 
* Analysis
	* Within this practice module Louisa had goals to produce a play in the USA and a musical in Great Britain. When I ran the numbers for her, she seemed to have had her fundraising goals on the higher end of the spectrum. In fact, her fundraising goal for the play was more than double the average goal of the successful drama fundraisers. 
	* In fact, Louisa’s goal is higher than the average goal of failed play fundraisers. 
	* There was some data that I found that could have helped Louisa meet her goal. Play fundraisers that began in May seemed to have a higher chance of success, so maybe if she timed it just right she may be able to meet her lofty goal.

* Conclusion
  * I highly suggest Louisa to lower her fundraising goal.
  * If unable to lower goal, then she must definitely begin her fundraising campaign in May or she’ll most likely come up short of her goal.
